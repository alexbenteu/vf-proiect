abstract="In this article, we present a small, complete, and efficient SAT-solver in the style of conflict-driven learning, as exemplified by Chaff. We aim to give sufficient details about implementation to enable the reader to construct his or her own solver in a very short time. This will allow users of SAT-solvers to make domain specific extensions or adaptions of current state-of-the-art SAT-techniques, to meet the needs of a particular application area. The presented solver is designed with this in mind, and includes among other things a mechanism for adding arbitrary boolean constraints. It also supports solving a series of related SAT-problems efficiently by an incremental SAT-interface.",

abstract="Preprocessing SAT instances can reduce their size considerably. We combine variable elimination with subsumption and self-subsuming resolution, and show that these techniques not only shrink the formula further than previous preprocessing efforts based on variable elimination, but also decrease runtime of SAT solvers substantially for typical industrial SAT problems. We discuss critical implementation details that make the reduction procedure fast enough to be practical.",
